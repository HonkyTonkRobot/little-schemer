## Scheme Journal 01
I've started learning scheme thanks to Mikey. I really appreciate his willingness to help me learn coding. I love learning from experienced people and it's just amazing how much he is willing to give.

I have already read the first 70 pages, but figured it was a good time to come back and take a few notes and reflect on what I've learned so far.

### The Little Schemer
My source for learning (Thanks Mikey!)

### commandments
There are ten commandments of scheme.

I have properly learned the first five commandments. 

I understand the differeneces in atoms, lists, and S-expressions

I've learned how to:
    - define a variable, 
    - how to define a function with a lambda expression, 
    - and creating conditions
    
I've learned the following primitives:
    - Car - used to get the first atom of a list
    - Cdr - to call the rest of the list
    - Cons - used to copy an S-expression onto the front of a new list
    - null? - for asking if the expression is null.
    - eq? - asking if the arguments in the expression are equal
